    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is my road (so far) to WWDC13. This should serve as a reminder to my future self to avoid WWDC next year.</p>

<p>The effort that went into getting a ticket is far more than I'm willing to admit... it's JUST a conference, after all! Here's a recap:</p>

<h2>Early April</h2>

<ol>
<li>Start researching WWDC history to be well prepared (see last section). I felt this was critical to get a ticket.</li>
<li>Rumors and trends converge towards a June 10-14 schedule, with an April 25th announcement</li>
<li>Sign up to 2 different WWDC announcement notification services (for redundancy)</li>
<li>Book round-trip flights and accommodations early to avoid much higher costs once they skyrocket after the announcement.</li>
</ol>


<h2>April 25</h2>

<ol>
<li>9:55, start repeatedly refreshing WWDC page</li>
<li>10:00:05, see purchase button, enter info</li>
<li>10:00:55, click "complete order"</li>
<li>Get error, enter info again</li>
<li>10:01:55, click "complete order"</li>
<li>Get redirected to WWDC where it says <a href="http://i97.photobucket.com/albums/l230/Insider2000/SpitCereal.png">"sold out"</a></li>
<li>Mope for a few minutes</li>
<li>Acceptance: Oh well, it's just a conference. I'll take this as a week-long vacation in SF. Go on with the rest of my day.</li>
<li>16:30, receive a phone call from Apple rep saying <strong>"We see you encountered some errors while purchasing your WWDC tickets this morning. I'd like to let you know that we have a ticket reserved for you and we'll be sending you an email with information on how to complete your purchase in the next twelve hours [sic]."</strong></li>
<li>Celebrate for a few minutes</li>
</ol>


<h2>April 26</h2>

<ol>
<li>14:27, receive email from Apple with instructions to complete the purchase</li>
<li>16:00, attempt to complete the purchase but run into another set of errors on:

<ul>
<li>Google Chrome</li>
<li>OS X Safari</li>
<li>iOS Safari</li>
<li>Firefox</li>
<li>reset OS X Safari</li>
<li>it works!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Finally complete the order.</li>
</ol>


<p>Note to self... avoid WWDC next year, people will be resort to writing bots to buy their tickets and the conference will sell out in 0.04s.</p>
