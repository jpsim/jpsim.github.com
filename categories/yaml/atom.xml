<p><a href="https://twitter.com/norio_nomura">Norio Nomura</a> and I (ok, honestly mostly Norio ðŸ˜…) have been building a
Swift library for encoding &amp; decoding <a href="http://yaml.org">YAML</a> for the last 18 months and
it's now stable enough to make a 1.0 release and share with the world.</p>

<p>It's called Yams, you can find it on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/jpsim/Yams">jpsim/Yams</a> and API
docs are located at <a href="https://jpsim.com/Yams">jpsim.com/Yams</a>.</p>

<p>You could say it's a Swift binding for <a href="https://github.com/yaml/libyaml">LibYAML</a> but I'd argue it's
much more than that.</p>

<p>I'm actually very happy with how this library ended up. It plays nicely with
Swift 4's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/archives_and_serialization/encoding_and_decoding_custom_types">Codable protocol</a>, meaning that you get fast &amp; type-safe
encoding &amp; decoding that feels right at home in modern Swift.</p>

<p>Here's a simple example of encoding &amp; decoding <code>Codable</code> types:</p>

<pre><code class="swift">import Yams

struct S: Codable {
  var p: String
}

let s = S(p: "test")
let encoder = YAMLEncoder()
let encodedYAML = try encoder.encode(s)
encodedYAML == """
  p: test

  """
let decoder = YAMLDecoder()
let decoded = try decoder.decode(S.self, from: encodedYAML)
s.p == decoded.p
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, you can use it to work with Swift scalar &amp; collection types,
which is probably the easiest way to start parsing arbitrary YAML for your
projects. Finally, there's a third mode, which is a Yams-native API that best
translates to how LibYAML works.</p>

<p>This library's been powering a number of popular projects that use YAML for
configuration, like <a href="https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint">SwiftLint</a>, <a href="https://github.com/SwiftGen/SwiftGen">SwiftGen</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen">XcodeGen</a> &amp; used in <a href="https://github.com/jpsim/SourceKitten">SourceKitten</a> to parse Swift
Package Manager build manifests. So if you've wanted to add YAML configuration
files to your Swift CLI, or want to interoperate with other tools that process
YAML, I encourage you to give Yams a try.</p>
