    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpsim/Yams/master/yams.jpg" alt="Yams: A Sweet &amp; Swifty YAML Parser" /></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/norio_nomura">Norio Nomura</a> and I (ok, honestly mostly Norio ðŸ˜…) have been building a
Swift library for encoding &amp; decoding <a href="http://yaml.org">YAML</a> for the last 18 months and
it's now stable enough to make a 1.0 release and share with the world.</p>

<p>It's called Yams, you can find it on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/jpsim/Yams">jpsim/Yams</a> and API
docs are located at <a href="https://jpsim.com/Yams">jpsim.com/Yams</a>.</p>

<p>You could say it's a Swift binding for <a href="https://github.com/yaml/libyaml">LibYAML</a> but I'd argue it's
much more than that.</p>

<p>I'm actually very happy with how this library ended up. It plays nicely with
Swift 4's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/archives_and_serialization/encoding_and_decoding_custom_types">Codable protocol</a>, meaning that you get fast &amp; type-safe
encoding &amp; decoding that feels right at home in modern Swift.</p>

<p>Here's a simple example of encoding &amp; decoding <code>Codable</code> types:</p>

<pre><code class="swift">import Yams

struct S: Codable {
  var p: String
}

let s = S(p: "test")
let encoder = YAMLEncoder()
let encodedYAML = try encoder.encode(s)
encodedYAML == """
  p: test

  """
let decoder = YAMLDecoder()
let decoded = try decoder.decode(S.self, from: encodedYAML)
s.p == decoded.p
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, you can use it to work with Swift scalar &amp; collection types,
which is probably the easiest way to start parsing arbitrary YAML for your
projects. Finally, there's a third mode, which is a Yams-native API that best
translates to how LibYAML works.</p>

<p>This library's been powering a number of popular projects that use YAML for
configuration, like <a href="https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint">SwiftLint</a>, <a href="https://github.com/SwiftGen/SwiftGen">SwiftGen</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen">XcodeGen</a> &amp; used in <a href="https://github.com/jpsim/SourceKitten">SourceKitten</a> to parse Swift
Package Manager build manifests. So if you've wanted to add YAML configuration
files to your Swift CLI, or want to interoperate with other tools that process
YAML, I encourage you to give Yams a try.</p>

    <id>https://jpsim.com/uncovering-sourcekit</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To support a <a href="http://developer.apple.com/swift">fancy new language</a>, nifty <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/recipes/xcode_help-source_editor/ExploringandEvaluatingSwiftCodeinaPlayground/ExploringandEvaluatingSwiftCodeinaPlayground.html">realtime IDE</a> features and impressive <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/InteractingWithObjective-CAPIs.html">cross-language interoperability</a>, Apple had to develop several new underlying tools. Here, we'll focus on <em>SourceKit</em>, Xcode's under-appreciated sidekick.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/sidekick.jpg" alt="sidekick" /></p>

<h2>What is SourceKit?</h2>

<p>SourceKit is the set of tools that enables most of Swift's source code manipulation features: source code parsing, syntax highlighting, typesetting, autocomplete, cross-language header generation, and lots more.</p>

<h2>Architecture</h2>

<p>Xcode traditionally runs its compiler (<a href="http://clang.llvm.org">Clang</a>) <em>in-process</em>, which means that any time the compiler would crash, so would the IDE.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/house_of_cards.jpg" alt="house of cards" /></p>

<center><sub>Xcode architecture diagram</sub></center>


<p><br/></p>

<p>Exacerbating the problem, Xcode can easily invoke the compiler thousands of times to parse, highlight and typeset source code, all before a user ever hits <em>âŒ˜+B</em>. That's because unlike most editors (Vim/Sublime/etc), Xcode doesn't use regular expressions to parse source code, but rather Clang's powerful (though much more complex) parser/tokenizer.</p>

<p>Thankfully, Swift in Xcode 6 moves away from this architecture<sup>1</sup>, combining all these source code manipulation features into a separate process that communicates with Xcode through <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/macosx/conceptual/bpsystemstartup/chapters/CreatingXPCServices.html">XPC</a>: <code>sourcekitd</code>. This XPC daemon is launched whenever Xcode 6 loads any Swift code.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/sourcekit_terminated.jpg" alt="sourcekit terminated" /></p>

<center><sub>Life would be miserable if Xcode crashed every time this appeared</sub></center>


<p><br/></p>

<h2>How Xcode uses SourceKit</h2>

<p>Since SourceKit is a private and undocumented tool, we need to get a little creative to learn how to use it. By setting the <code>SOURCEKIT_LOGGING</code><sup>2</sup> environment variable, Xcode will log its SourceKit communications to <code>stdout</code>, allowing us to monitor its communications in realtime. This is how many of the commands covered in this article were discovered.</p>

<h2>Unified Symbol Resolution</h2>

<p>SourceKit uses a Clang feature called the USR (Unified Symbol Resolution) as a unique identifier for a source code token (i.e. class, property, method, etc.). This is what allows you to <em>âŒ˜+click</em> any token in Xcode and navigate to its definition. The USR is even more powerful now that it can unify a representation across languages (Swift/ObjC).</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/usr.jpg" alt="usr" /></p>

<center><sub>The USR at work</sub></center>


<p><br/></p>

<p>To print the USR's from a Swift file (and their locations), you can run the following command:</p>

<pre><code>$ xcrun swift-ide-test -print-usrs -source-filename=Musician.swift
10:7 s:C14swift_ide_test8Musician
14:9 s:vC14swift_ide_test8Musician4nameSS
19:9 s:vC14swift_ide_test8Musician9birthyearSu
33:5 s:FC14swift_ide_test8MusiciancFMS0_FT4nameSS9birthyearSu_S0_
33:10 s:vFC14swift_ide_test8MusiciancFMS0_FT4nameSS9birthyearSu_S0_L_4nameSS
33:24 s:vFC14swift_ide_test8MusiciancFMS0_FT4nameSS9birthyearSu_S0_L_9birthyearSu
34:9 s:vFC14swift_ide_test8MusiciancFMS0_FT4nameSS9birthyearSu_S0_L_4selfS0_
34:21 s:vFC14swift_ide_test8MusiciancFMS0_FT4nameSS9birthyearSu_S0_L_4nameSS
35:9 s:vFC14swift_ide_test8MusiciancFMS0_FT4nameSS9birthyearSu_S0_L_4selfS0_
35:26 s:vFC14swift_ide_test8MusiciancFMS0_FT4nameSS9birthyearSu_S0_L_9birthyearSu
</code></pre>

<h2>Swift<em>ish</em> header generation</h2>

<p><em>âŒ˜+clicking</em> on a token defined in Objective-C from Swift will cause Xcode to trigger a Swift-like header to be generated. I say Swift-like because this generated file is not valid Swift<sup>3</sup>, but at least displays the Swift syntax equivalent to the Objective-C tokens.</p>

<p><a href="/images/posts/generated_swift_header.jpg"><img src="/images/posts/generated_swift_header.jpg" alt="Generated Swift Header" /></a></p>

<center><sub>Left: original Objective-C header. Right: SourceKit-generated Swift-ish version.</sub></center>


<p><br/></p>

<h2>Using SourceKit from the command line</h2>

<p><img src="/images/posts/sourcekit_playground.jpg" alt="SourceKit Playground" /></p>

<p>There are 3 main command line tools that allow to interact with SourceKit: <code>sourcekitd-test</code>, <code>swift-ide-test</code> and <code>swift</code>.</p>

<p>I compiled a shell script with documentation that runs through many useful commands like syntax highlighting, interface generation, AST parsing, demangling, and more.</p>

<p>The script is available on GitHub as a <a href="https://gist.github.com/jpsim/13971c81445219db1c63#file-sourcekit_playground-sh">gist</a>.</p>

<h2>3rd Party Tools Using SourceKit</h2>

<p>Because SourceKit lives outside of Xcode, itâ€™s possible to leverage it to build anything from a Swift IDE to a documentation generator.</p>

<h3>jazzy<sup>â™ªâ™«</sup></h3>

<p><img src="/images/posts/jazzy.jpg" alt="jazzy" /></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/realm/jazzy">jazzy</a> is a command-line utility that generates documentation for your Swift and Objective-C projects. It uses SourceKit to derive Swift syntax from Objective-C defined tokens (i.e. class, property, method, etc.).</p>

<h3>SwiftEdit</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jpsim/SwiftEdit">SwiftEdit</a> is a proof-of-concept editor that supports syntax highlighting for Swift files.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/SwiftEdit.png" alt="SwiftEdit" /></p>

<h2>SourceKit &amp; You</h2>

<p>Weâ€™re just scratching the surface of whatâ€™s possible to build with SourceKit. Tools could be made to measure cross-language code coverage, or provide an editor where Objective-C and Swift can be edited simultaneously. Hopefully this article inspires you to build something with SourceKit and improve our tools in the process.</p>

<hr />

<p><em>1: Objective-C in Xcode 6 (Beta 2) doesn't use SourceKit at all, keeping Xcode's traditional clang-in-process architecture. I expect this to change before Xcode 6 GM.</em></p>

<p><em>2: For SourceKit logging, launch Xcode with <sub><code>export SOURCEKIT_LOGGING=3 &amp;&amp; /Applications/Xcode6-Beta2.app/Contents/MacOS/Xcode</code></sub></em></p>

<p><em>3: Speculation: I expect private Swift modules to expose public interfaces using a similar syntax once the language has <a href="https://github.com/ksm/SwiftInFlux#access-control">access control mechanisms</a>.</em></p>
