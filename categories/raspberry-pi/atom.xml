    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My son and I built an NFC-based music player so he can play the music he
wants, develop his own musical taste but most of all so that he and I
could have something fun to build together.</p>

<p>Kind of like a modern day record player, but infinitely more extensible,
and with each album costing 1/100th the price of a vinyl record.</p>

<p>Here it is in action (<em>music starts 9 seconds into the video, set your
volume to low</em>):</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>And here's how we built it:</p>

<h2>Materials</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08YT3BWMP">Amazon Echo Dot, $20</a>:
For the price, this is a surprisingly hackable, portable speaker. I would have
prefered something without any microphones at all, but I <em>mostly</em> trust the
hardware mute switch.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/739034156">Case, $20</a>: Beautiful
retro-style case for the Raspberry Pi. The top compartment is made to
house a fan, but this is where I put the NFC module instead. The folks
who make this at <a href="https://twitter.com/theC4Labs">C4 Labs</a> were <a href="https://twitter.com/simjp/status/1259980961665576960">super nice</a>.
We broke a piece when we started building the box and they sent a
replacement part right away.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/">Raspberry Pi, $35</a>:
I chose to go with a Raspberry Pi because they're cheap, have good
compatible NFC modules, lots of case options on Etsy and easy to
develop on.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CSTW0IA">NFC Module, $5</a>: I can't
believe this thing is just $5. Works great. Lots of good tutorials on
connecting this to a Raspberry Pi.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.gototags.com/nfc-pvc-card-ntag213/">NFC Cards, $29</a>:
I got 100 cards at $0.29 each.</li>
</ul>


<p>In total, this adds up to $109, but in my case I already had a Raspberry
Pi and an Echo Dot lying around that I could repurpose for this, so it
cost me closer to $55.</p>

<h2>Services</h2>

<p>I'm already an Apple Music subscriber, so using that as the music source
was the cheapest solution, although this setup would work with any music
service that works with Amazon Echo: Spotify, Amazon Music, TuneIn,
CloudPlayer, Deezer, iHeartRadio.</p>

<p>In the exploration phase for this project, I wanted to buy DRM-free
music, wire a speaker directly to the Raspberry Pi and play it locally.
However, that would have meant that adding music later would be a much
more tedious task. Plus it's hard to find DRM-free music these days, and
when you do find what you want it ends up being pricey. Especially
compared to the convenience and cost of today's streaming options.</p>

<p>I also explored using HomePods as the speakers (see addendum below).</p>

<p>The biggest downside to the current streaming approach is that there's a
5-10 second delay after tapping a card and music starting.</p>

<p>I assembled this with my son over a few days in May 2020, and then
finished the setup in September 2021. The actual hardware assembly
probably only took a combined total of 3 hours though.</p>

<h2>Software</h2>

<p><em>Disclaimer: This code is rough, it's suitable for a toy project. I'm
sharing it in case it's useful for others getting started with a similar,
project. I'm not claiming this is beautiful quality code.</em></p>

<h3>Echo Dot Remote Control</h3>

<p>I use the <a href="https://github.com/thorsten-gehrig/alexa-remote-control">alexa-remote-control</a> shell script to
control the Echo Dot. When it's up and running, it couldn't be easier:</p>

<pre><code class="shell">$ alexa_remote_control.sh -e "playmusic:APPLE_MUSIC:The Lion King"
$ alexa_remote_control.sh -e pause
$ alexa_remote_control.sh -e play
$ alexa_remote_control.sh -e vol:15
</code></pre>

<h3>NFC Reader</h3>

<p>I use <a href="https://github.com/pelwell/MFRC522-python">MFRC522-python</a> to
interface with the NFC module.</p>

<p>The Python script that reads cards and plays music looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import MFRC522
import os
import signal

continue_reading = True
last_seen_card = None
echo_name = "MusicBox Echo"
current_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
alexa_control_script = os.path.join(current_dir, "alexa_remote_control.sh")

def alexa(command):
    os.system(
        '{alexa_control_script} -d "{echo_name}" -e "{command}"'.format(
            alexa_control_script=alexa_control_script,
            echo_name=echo_name,
            command=command,
        )
    )

def pause():
    alexa("pause")

def play_music(query):
    print(query)
    pause()
    alexa("playmusic:APPLE_MUSIC:{query}".format(query=query))

def set_volume(volume):
    alexa("vol:{volume}".format(volume=volume))

def end_read(signal, frame):
    global continue_reading
    continue_reading = False
    GPIO.cleanup()

signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, end_read)

MIFAREReader = MFRC522.MFRC522()

while continue_reading:
    # Scan for cards
    (status, TagType) = MIFAREReader.MFRC522_Request(MIFAREReader.PICC_REQIDL)

    # If we have a card, continue
    if status == MIFAREReader.MI_OK:
        # Get the UID of the card
        (status, uid) = MIFAREReader.MFRC522_Anticoll()

        # If we have the UID, continue
        if status == MIFAREReader.MI_OK and last_seen_card != uid:
            last_seen_card = uid

            # Print UID
            print("Card UID: %s" % uid)
            if uid == [136, 4, 76, 240, 48]:
                print("PAUSE")
                pause()
            elif uid == [136, 4, 236, 236, 140]:
                set_volume(10)
            elif uid == [136, 4, 247, 42, 81]:
                set_volume(40)
            elif uid == [136, 4, 137, 170, 175]:
                play_music("Star Wars A New Hope Soundtrack")
            elif uid == [136, 4, 148, 191, 167]:
                play_music("Paco de Lucia")
            elif uid == [136, 4, 160, 224, 204]:
                play_music("Dexter Gordon")
            elif uid == [136, 4, 197, 238, 167]:
                play_music("Rainbow Connection")
            elif uid == [136, 4, 2, 220, 82]:
                play_music("Genesis")
            elif uid == [136, 4, 232, 57, 93]:
                # and so on...
</code></pre>

<p>You'll notice that there are special cards for pausing, setting a high
volume and setting a low volume. The rest of the cards map to music.</p>

<p>The main thing I'd like to improve at some point is to avoid hardcoding
a mapping of the card UIDs to music and instead program it using the
companion iPhone app by writing a payload to the card. The iOS side I
know how to do pretty quickly, but I'd have to spend more time to figure
out how to do it on the MFRC522 reader side of things.</p>

<h3>API Server</h3>

<p>There's an API server that can be used to control the music box using
the companion iPhone app.</p>

<pre><code class="python">from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import os

api = Flask(__name__)
echo_name = "MusicBox Echo"
current_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
alexa_control_script = os.path.join(current_dir, "alexa_remote_control.sh")

def alexa(command):
    os.system(
        '{alexa_control_script} -d "{echo_name}" -e "{command}"'.format(
            alexa_control_script=alexa_control_script,
            echo_name=echo_name,
            command=command,
        )
    )

@api.route("/pause", methods=["POST"])
def pause():
    alexa("pause")
    return "{}"

@api.route("/play", methods=["POST"])
def play():
    if request.json:
        play_music(request.json["query"])
    else:
        alexa("play")
    return "{}"

@api.route("/play/&lt;query&gt;", methods=["POST"])
def play_music(query):
    print(query)
    pause
    alexa("playmusic:APPLE_MUSIC:{query}".format(query=query))
    return "{}"

@api.route("/volume/&lt;int:volume&gt;", methods=["POST"])
def set_volume(volume):
    alexa("vol:{volume}".format(volume=volume))
    return "{}"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    api.run(host="0.0.0.0")
</code></pre>

<h3>iPhone App</h3>

<p>Of course I made an iPhone app using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/">SwiftUI</a> &amp;
<a href="https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture">Composable Architecture</a>.</p>

<p>This helps me quickly adjust the volume, play/pause and play specific
music. If my kid falls alseep to music, I can stop it without having to
walk into his room.</p>

<p>Siri intents work too, so I can play/pause music by speaking to Siri
without having to launch the app.</p>

<h2>Closed Source</h2>

<p>Hopefully this post is helpful to someone interested in building
something similar. I've posted enough code and details to get you
started, but I won't be open sourcing the whole project because I'm just
not willing to field support questions or feature requests. I'm happy to
answer questions about my experience building this, but I'm sorry I
can't help you figure out why something's not working if you go build
something similar.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Addendum: HomePod Attempt</h2>

<p>At one point I wanted to use a stereo pair of HomePods for this project,
but all my attempts to reverse engineer a way to play music on them from
a Raspberry Pi were fruitless. I tried sniffing the network traffic via
Charles Proxy while playing music from the iOS Music app or even the
Shortcuts app and wasn't able to crack it. I did end up getting it
working using <a href="https://github.com/owntone/owntone-server">forked-daap</a> but this set the HomePods in a
weird state. I don't remember all the details because I gave up on that
approach for two reasons: the first is that I couldn't get it to work
well and the second is that I wanted to keep the HomePods in our living
room while the music box was meant to be in my son's bedroom.</p>
