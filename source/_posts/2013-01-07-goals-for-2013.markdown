Writing my goals for 2013 publicly to keep myself accountable.

## Gig monthly
### What?
There was a time when I played sax at local restaurants, corporate gigs, heck I even [recorded an album](http://mgn.tc/psgroove) with [my brother](http://patricksimard.com) that sold pretty decently.

### How?
I've got a bassist, drummer and guitarist lined up. I'm approaching several of the bars/restaurants I used to play to set up some gigs.

## Learn Japanese
### What?
[Christine](http://twitter.com/c_contant) and I will be learning Japanese this year. Our goal is to reach survival-in-Japan level by the end of the year.

### How?
I bought all 3 levels of Rosetta Stone Japanese today. 3x 20 minutes and an hour-long session with Christine once a week.

## Get featured on Hacker News
### What?
I'd certainly like to refine my writing abilities and this is a stretch goal to accomplish that.

### How?
Blogging here and on the [MBS Labs](http://magneticbear.com/labs) website weekly.

## Run a 3:30 marathon
### What?
I'm not in the shape I'd like to be. I ran a 4:00 marathon last year and I can already run a 1:30 half marathon so this is the next logical step.

### How?
Following the [RunKeeper training plan](http://runkeeper.com/fitness-class/running-marathon/12). Track my progress on my [RunKeeper profile](http://runkeeper.com/user/jpsim/profile).

## Bike daily
### What?
Starting on February 1st (in the snow for an added challenge). This doesn't apply to days I have to drive.

### How?
I'm buying a bike and doing it!
