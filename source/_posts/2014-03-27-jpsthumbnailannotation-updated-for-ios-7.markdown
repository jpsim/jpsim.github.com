I've just given a fresh coat of iOS7-flavoured paint to my most popular open-source library: JPSThumbnailAnnotation.

Check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/jpsim/JPSThumbnailAnnotation) or just add it to CocoaPods: `pod 'JPSThumbnailAnnotation'`.

I decided not to maintain the iOS 6 *style*, but iOS 6 is still supported.

By the way, this is what the old style looked like. It's still in git, if you need to find it for some reason.
