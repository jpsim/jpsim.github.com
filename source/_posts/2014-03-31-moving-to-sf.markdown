I'm excited to share that I'll be joining an awesome [YC] company in San Francisco, starting in 2 weeks!

The company has yet to launch, so I can't say much about it, but I *can* tell you that I wouldn't have joined it if I didn't think it has the potential to change how software is built on a fundamental level.

This decision is actually the result of over 6 weeks of careful job hunting and deliberation, so it wasn't done on a whim.

I've had a blast building [Magnetic Bear Studios][MBS] over the last 3 years, but it's time to move on. The truth is, I'm a product builder, not a business builder. It's what I love. And that's what I'll be doing at this new job. The other stuff was always incidental to me, but was taking up the majority of my attention.

I look forward to sharing more with you once we launch!
