Over the holidays, I *upgraded* my personal website to use [Octopress](http://octopress.org).

It's one of those *beautifully crafted* frameworks that manages to be both clean **and** powerful. I knew right away that I'd want to occasionally blog from my iPhone, so I sketched out the basic mechanics of an Octopress iPhone app.

Not as easy as it sounds, because its strengths are also what make it difficult to support natively on iOS: git-versioned, GitHub-hosted, ruby-based.
