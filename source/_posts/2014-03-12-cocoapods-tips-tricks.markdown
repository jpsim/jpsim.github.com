[Cocoapods][1] documentation isn't very opiniated, which can cause confusion for newcomers. Here are a few tricks I've picked up after building a few dozen projects with Cocoapods.

## Source Control

Should you check in `Podfile.lock`? How about your `*.xcworkspace` and the `Pods` directory? Since all of these are automatically generated by running `pod install`, is it redundant to also include them in your source control?

The Cocoapods GitHub repository has an [example][2], in which they check in the `*.xcworkspace` but not `Podfile.lock` and not the `Pods` directory.

My approach is to check in `Podfile.lock` but not `xcworkspace` and `Pods`. Here's why:

### Podfile.lock

Checking in `Podfile.lock` has the advantage of keeping track of the pod versions last used when working on the project. Also, if you run `pod install` and some pods have changed versions, you'll see the change in your next commit, encouraging you to confirm that nothing broke.

### Workspace

In most cases, checking in the `*.xcworkspace` to source control is unnecessary, since `pod install` will automatically generate it for you. There are rare cases in which you need to customize it, in which case you should check it in.

### Pods Directory

Checking in the `Pods` directory is rarely the way to go. Much like node.js projects ignore `node_modules`. The Cocoapods people even have a `Pods` entry in their [`.gitignore`][3].

### Finalizing a Project

If I'm going to stop working on a project for a while, or I'm handing it off to a client, I'll create a branch with everything checked in. `Podfile.lock`, `*.xcworkspace` and `Pods`. This way, even if pods change over time, or they're removed from github, or whatever happens, I'm sure to have a working version of my project.

## Modifying Pods

Before modifying a pod, ask yourself if it's necessary. Often, a category or subclass will do.

Pre-cocoapods, when all vendored code was checked in, it was trivial to make small changes to 3rd party code. It's still easy now, but not as obvious. There are many ways to make changes to Pods in your project:

### 1. Pull Request

If your modifications are useful to other users of the 3rd party library, then consider submitting a [Pull Request][4]. This way, everyone benefits. Hopefully it will be merged quickly.

### 2. Fork

Certain projects are notorious for taking a long time to merge PR's ([cough][5]). In those cases or cases when your PR's aren't accepted, it can be useful to just point your `Podfile` to your fork of the project. Add this to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'KIF', :git => 'https://github.com/ksuther/KIF'
```

The downside to this approach is that you have to keep your fork up to date, which is where the patchfile approach comes in.

### 3. Diffs

If your modifications are small, I'd encourage you to use patchfiles (`*.diff`) to apply them to your pods. This will apply your modifications every time you run `pod install`, with the added benefit of using the latest upstream updates. To see how it works, take a look at this github project: [jpsim/pod-diffs][6].

*Sidenote: patchfiles are super neat! Even if you modify code around your modification or the line numbers change, it's smart enought to find it again!*

### 4. Check it in

This is a last resort. If all other methods fail, check in your vendored code into your project outside of Cocoapods. Then, you're free to modify it in any way you see fit. But then you need to update it manually when the upstream version changes.

## Continuous Integration & Xcode Bots

There's this misconception that using Xcode 5's [Bots] feature for CI with cocoapods projects means that you **must** check in your pods. In fact, Xcode Bots have the ability to run scripts prior to building your app. Check out [this gist][7] for a comprehensive guide to Bots and Cocoapods.
