I recently gave a talk on [Swift] at the [SF/SV Swift Language User Group][slug] meetup. We've made the whole thing available online:

* [Video](http://realm.io/news/swift-unchartered-territory-swift-intro-and-internals)
* [Slides](https://speakerdeck.com/jpsim/swift-uncharted-territory)
* [Slides Source](https://github.com/jpsim/talks)

The first half of the talk covers the basic features and syntax of the language. The rest of the talk touches on some more in-depth discoveries about the runtime, introspection and how the tools work behind the scenes.
