This is my road (so far) to WWDC13. This should serve as a reminder to my future self to avoid WWDC next year.

The effort that went into getting a ticket is far more than I'm willing to admit... it's JUST a conference, after all! Here's a recap:

## Early April

1. Start researching WWDC history to be well prepared (see last section). I felt this was critical to get a ticket.
2. Rumors and trends converge towards a June 10-14 schedule, with an April 25th announcement
3. Sign up to 2 different WWDC announcement notification services (for redundancy)
4. Book round-trip flights and accommodations early to avoid much higher costs once they skyrocket after the announcement.

## April 25

1. 9:55, start repeatedly refreshing WWDC page
2. 10:00:05, see purchase button, enter info
3. 10:00:55, click "complete order"
4. Get error, enter info again
5. 10:01:55, click "complete order"
6. Get redirected to WWDC where it says ["sold out"](http://i97.photobucket.com/albums/l230/Insider2000/SpitCereal.png)
7. Mope for a few minutes
8. Acceptance: Oh well, it's just a conference. I'll take this as a week-long vacation in SF. Go on with the rest of my day.
9. 16:30, receive a phone call from Apple rep saying **"We see you encountered some errors while purchasing your WWDC tickets this morning. I'd like to let you know that we have a ticket reserved for you and we'll be sending you an email with information on how to complete your purchase in the next twelve hours [sic]."**
10. Celebrate for a few minutes

## April 26

1. 14:27, receive email from Apple with instructions to complete the purchase
2. 16:00, attempt to complete the purchase but run into another set of errors on:
    * Google Chrome
    * OS X Safari
    * iOS Safari
    * Firefox
    * reset OS X Safari
    * it works!
3. Finally complete the order.

Note to self... avoid WWDC next year, people will be resort to writing bots to buy their tickets and the conference will sell out in 0.04s.
