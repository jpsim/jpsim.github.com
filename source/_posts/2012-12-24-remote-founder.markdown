*Every minute* a founder is away from their team is costly.

``` ruby
ruby_code
```

Opportunities to do some business development, or to help out a client for a short while may seem tempting, but if it means being unavailable to your team, you **must** keep this period as short as possible. *This effect is compounded the smaller your team is.*

In August, one of our *[awesome](http://openera.com)* clients invited us to work alongside them in Montréal for 2 months during their stint at the [Founder Fuel](http://founderfuel.com) accelerator.

There were many advantages for us to join them there:

* Proximity to our growing Montréal client base
* Business development opportunities in a new city (more than 50% of our leads come from there)
* Chance to meet and interview MTL-based devs

But overall, being away from my team 3 days a week for 2 months had a noticeable impact on performance and most of all, our *culture*.

So choose your battles carefully and fight alongside your team.
