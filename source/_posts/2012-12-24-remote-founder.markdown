There may be times in a founder's life when they're compelled to taste freedom from their own company... here's what I learned from my remote experience.

From September to November, one of our *[awesome](http://openera.com)* clients invited us to work alongside them in Montréal during their stint at the [Founder Fuel](http://founderfuel.com) accelerator.

All of our staff at the time (6) were very busy with other projects and so I took it upon myself to get back to my dev roots and go there myself. From the outset, the team and I knew that this would be challenging. So we weighed the pros/cons and came to this:

## Pros
* Proximity to our growing Montréal client base (3 other clients there at the time)
* Ability to do some business development in a new city
* Interview opportunities with MTL-based devs

## Cons
* Difficult to lead a remote team, especially with a busy schedule
*
